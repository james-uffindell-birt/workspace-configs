# some actually sane color configurations
# preferably set terminal background to #13040e or #0d000d or something similarly faintly purple but v dark
# current colors used are:
# 221 - pale marigold, used for current branch
# 214 - mid orange, used for no branch (detached HEAD) and whitespace diffs
# 209 - peach, used for misc local branches
# 141 - lilac, used for remote branches, diff function names
# 107 - moss green, used for upstream branches
# 241 - dark grey, used for 'background' data
# 215 - pinkish orange, used for various meta and header information
# 117 - pale blue, used for untracked files and diff hunk information
# 160 - mid red, used for diff removals, unmerged files, and miscellaneous errors
# 148 - light green, used for diff additions, changed files, and miscellaneous help
# 064 - dark green, used for backgrounded grep matches only

#use a bunch of these, plus some extra ones, for log graphing
#TODO still sort out the other colors in lgs
